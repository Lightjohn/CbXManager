# CbXManager
Easily create/extract cbz or cbr files with a python script, can split and adapt to manga read order

# Purpose
I need to manage book or images and sometimes I need to deal with the folder and another with the cbz file.
CbXManager can guess the input and:

  If the input is a folder -> it will create a cbz
  If the input is a cbz it will extract it
  
I added some options: like splitting the wide images in two and reverse the read order to adapt to manga.

# Example

```
myFolder/image1.jpg
myFolder/image1.jpg
myFolder/image1.jpg
```
